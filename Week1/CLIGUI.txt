Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) are two distinct ways users interact with computers. CLI relies on text commands entered into a terminal or command prompt, emphasizing efficiency for users familiar with specific commands. Users input commands to execute tasks, and the interface responds with textual feedback. This method is powerful and resource-efficient, often favored by experienced users and system administrators.

On the other hand, GUI provides a visual environment with graphical elements like icons, buttons, and windows. Users interact with the system by clicking, dragging, and dropping elements, making it more intuitive for those less familiar with command-based systems. GUIs are user-friendly and widely adopted in operating systems and applications, enhancing accessibility for a broader audience.

The key distinction lies in the mode of interaction CLI is text based and requires specific commands, while GUI is visual and relies on mouse based actions. Each has its strengths, CLI is powerful and scriptable, while GUI is user-friendly and accessible, catering to different user preferences and skill levels. The choice between CLI and GUI often depends on the user's expertise, the nature of the task, and personal preference.
